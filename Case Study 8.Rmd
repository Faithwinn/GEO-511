# Download a csv from noaa with storm track information
```
dataurl="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r01/access/csv/ibtracs.NA.list.v04r01.csv"

```
#Read the data into a csv file and view 
storm_data <- read_csv(dataurl)
View(storm_data)


# Step 2: Wrangle the data
We have to create a new column with just the year using year(ISO_TIME)
Filter to storms 1950-present with filter()

```{r}
storm_new <- storm_data %>%
  mutate(year = year(ISO_TIME)) %>%              # Add year column
  filter(year >= 1950) %>%                       # Filter to storms 1950-present
  mutate_if(is.numeric, function(x) ifelse(x == -999.0, NA, x)) %>%  # Convert -999 to NA
  mutate(decade = floor(year / 10) * 10)         # Add decade column

```
# Step 3: Convert data to sf object
```{r}
storms <- st_as_sf(storm_new, coords = c("LON", "LAT"), crs = 4326)

# Step 4: Identify bounding box of the storm data
region <- st_bbox(storms)
```

## Including Plots

Make the first plot

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world,fill = "grey80" ) +
  stat_bin2d(data = storms, aes(x = st_coordinates(storms)[,1], y = st_coordinates(storms)[,2]), bins = 100) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", trans = "log", direction = -1, breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000)) +
  facet_wrap(~decade) +
  coord_sf(ylim = region[c(2, 4)], xlim = region[c(1, 3)]) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Summary plot of storm track data from NOAA")
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Now, we will calculate the top 5 states 
```{r}
states <- us_states %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(storms)) %>%   # Reproject to match storms data
  select(state = NAME)               # Rename NAME column to state

# Step 7: Perform spatial join to find storms within each state
storm_states <- st_join(storms, states, join = st_intersects, left = FALSE) #This will ‘add’ the state to any storm that was recorded within that state.

```
# Step 8: Summarize storm counts by state

```{r}
storm_counts <- storm_states %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(storms = length(unique(NAME))) %>% #to count how many unique storms occurred in each state.
  arrange(desc(storms)) %>%
  slice(1:5)%>%  # Keep only top 5 states
  select(state, storms)         # to select only state and storms columns

```
# View the table of the top 5 states

```{r}
print(storm_counts)
```

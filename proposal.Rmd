# Introduction
Diabetes is a major health concern globally. Identifying and predicting this disease in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression.According to the statistics of the International Diabetes Federation, about 537 million people worldwide (10.5% of the global population) suffer from diabetes, and it is estimated that 643 million people will develop the condition (11.3% of the total population) by 2030. If this trend continues, the number will jump to 783 million (12.2%) by 2045. 

# Problem / Question
Prediction of diabetes from the onset can help healthcare providers take early preventive measures. This project aims to build a predictive model for diabetes using readily available patient data and key variables, such as pregnancies, glucose levels, BMI, and genetic factors.

In addition, I will create visual summaries to communicate the insights and patterns identified in the data. The major objectives include:

1. Collecting and cleaning the diabetes dataset with relevant health variables.
2. Applying machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or random forest, to predict diabetes cases.
3. Creating visual summaries to show the relationships between key variables.
4. Finally, evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.

# Inspiring Examples

This shows the distribution of diabetes from a dataset used in a research paper.Visualization tools were employed to explore the distribution of data for diabetic patients and to identify correlations between diabetes and other relevant variables.
This type of graphic could be produced and enhanced in R using ggplot.

This is a correlation matrix that shows the relationship between different variables. It is from a similar study on Kaggle and can be recreated in R for my project. 

## Example 3

This is a screenshot from a project that predicted diabetes and created a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework. I thought this was interesting. 

# Proposed data sources

Data will be gotten from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This data is retrospective and may not be used if not comprehensive. The project has a backup dataset found in a study (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAplOYO-k7ZYHj4uHAY1tEr8VTeaxS6u/view?usp=sharing) by Chou et al.,(2023). 
Both dataset contains the following variables:
1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age: Age (years)
9. Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

# Proposed methods
The following methods and processes will be implemented in this project: 

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: The dataset for this project contains information on pregnancies, glucose levels, BMI, insulin, age, and other columns. The first step will be to clean the data and check for missing values. 

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualizations, including density plots, boxplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps, will be generated using the ggplot2. The figures will help us understand patterns in the data, such as the relationship between glucose levels and the likelihood of diabetes.

3. Model Development: We would either use a Random Forest classifier or logistic regression model to predict diabetes. This algorithms are good for handling complex interactions between variables and for avoiding overfitting. 

4. Evaluation: After the development, the models will be tested using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. A train-test split or cross-validation approach will be used to ensure the robustness of the model performance.

5. Visualization and Reporting: Visualizations will then be created to include feature importance plots and ROC curves. A Quarto document will be created to automatically generate reports in various formats (HTML, Word, PowerPoint, PDF), allowing the results to be easily shared and presented.

# Expected results

This project expects to develop a very accurate diabetes prediction model and create intuitive and visualizations to explain the complex relationships between various health factors and diabetes risk. By automating the reporting process with Quarto, the model will be then continuously be updated as new data becomes available. That way, we are providing healthcare professionals with timely insights to assess and manage diabetes risk effectively.
